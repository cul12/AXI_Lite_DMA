# AXI_Lite_DMA
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Master DMA Controller using the AXI-Lite protocol for efficient data transfer. The design utilizes finite state machines (FSMs) for read/write operations and a FIFO buffer to manage data flow. Proper AXI-Lite handshaking ensures reliable communication between master and slave.
The implementation is functional, but I am actively working on improving testbench coverage and handling edge cases for better compatibility. 
This repository includes the Verilog source code, testbench, and documentation.
